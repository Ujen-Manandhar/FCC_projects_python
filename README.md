These Projects are projects done in free code camp for learning python.

## 1. [Ceaser Cipher](https://github.com/Ujen-Manandhar/FCC_projects_python/blob/main/1.%20Ceaser_cipher.ipynb)[^1]
The Ceaser Cipher project helped me take a grasp of `for loops`, `if...else` statement, `function`, and the `.find` method and indexing <br/>
The Cipher is simple project which takes in the user input and shifts the letters in order to create a chiper text

## 2. [Vigenère cipher](https://github.com/Ujen-Manandhar/FCC_projects_python/blob/main/2.%20Vigen%C3%A8re%20cipher.ipynb)[^1]
The Vigenère cipher project hepled in taking a grasp of the indexing in python, along with getting a grasp of functional programming <br/>
This project also helped me identify innovative way of using modulo operator`%` to wrap numbers around a string; to wrap around a text let’s say if the text is to be repeated then the second text is small or is an end we can use the modulo operator `%` to wrap around the text
