# FCC_projects_python
These Projects are projects done in free code camp for learning python.
---
## 1. [Ceaser Cipher](https://github.com/Ujen-Manandhar/FCC_projects_python/blob/main/1.%20Ceaser_cipher.ipynb)[^1]<br/>
The Ceaser Cipher project helped me take a grasp of `for loops`, `if...else` statement, `function`, and the `.find` method and indexing. <br/> 
The Cipher is simple project which takes in the user input and shifts the letters in order to create a chiper text<br/>

## 2. [Vigenère cipher](https://github.com/Ujen-Manandhar/FCC_projects_python/blob/main/2.%20Vigen%C3%A8re%20cipher.ipynb)[^1]
The Vigenère cipher project hepled in taking a grasp of the indexing in python, along with getting a grasp of functional programming. <br/>
This project also helped me identify innovative way of using modulo operator`%` to wrap numbers around a string; to wrap around a text let’s say if the text is to be repeated then the second text is small or is an end we can use the modulo operator `%` to wrap around the text.

## 3. [Luhn Algorithm](https://github.com/Ujen-Manandhar/FCC_projects_python/blob/main/3.%20Luhn_algo.ipynb)[^1]
The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers.<br/>
In this project `string slicing [::]` along with method `replace`, `str.maketrans` and `translate` were understood, The project also helped in grasping the concept of using quotient`//` and modulus`%` to identify the first and second digit.<br/>
```
my_number = 12
first_digit = my_number // 10
second_digit = my_number % 10
# here the first digit is one and the second digit is two.
```
